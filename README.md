GameNative lets you run the PC games in your Steam, Epic and GOG libraries directly on Android — no streaming required. Your saves sync to the cloud, so you can stop on your PC and keep going on your phone.

It's still early. Not every game runs yet, and some need tweaking to play well, but the community is constantly finding and sharing configs that work — and these get applied automatically. You can see if anyone has tried running your game successfully at https://gamenative.app/compatibility.

## ✨ What this fork adds: RetroArch shader support (librashader)

This fork brings **native RetroArch shader support** to GameNative's Vulkan renderer: every game frame is pushed through a [librashader](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader) filter chain before it hits the screen, so you can apply the same CRT, LCD, scanline, upscaling and color-grading effects you know from RetroArch to your PC games — switched live from the in-game effects panel, with no restart required.

**What's included:**

- [librashader](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader) Vulkan runtime (built from source in the Gradle build — no prebuilts)
- **The full [libretro/slang-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/slang-shaders) catalog on demand** — 2,541 presets across 35 families (CRT, LCD, cel, HDR, NTSC, color grading…). The APK ships no shader files, only a metadata manifest (`catalog.json`, ~600 KB), so the whole catalog is browsable instantly and offline. Picking any preset downloads a single ~53 MB pack once, then applies it automatically
- Live preset switching (in-game effects panel or per-container config), verified on Adreno 650 with an automated black-box test loop
- A hardened pipeline: chain access from the render thread only, failure fallback (a broken preset degrades to the unshaded frame instead of a black screen), create-first preset swap and bounded fence waits

### How it was built — credit where credit is due

Shipping this feature meant studying how established emulators integrate librashader in Vulkan. An **automated agent** reviewed the production implementations of two reference projects and ported their battle-tested patterns into GameNative's compositor:

- **[melonDS](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS)** — the DS/DSi emulator by [StapleButter](https://github.com/StapleButter) and contributors — together with the **[melonDS Android port](https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android)** by Rafael Caetano (v0.7.0.rc2), contributed the offscreen → sampler → swapchain present topology, the image-layout tracking and the wide memory barriers that keep the Adreno driver honest.
- **[ARMSX2](https://github.com/ARMSX2/ARMSX2)** — the native-ARM64 fork of [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net) — contributed the render-thread parameter application pattern, the chain failure fallback + latch, and the create-first swap that keeps the previous shader alive when a new preset fails to build.

To the melonDS developers, Rafael Caetano, the PCSX2 team, the **ARMSX2 team**, [SnowflakePowered](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered) for librashader, and the [libretro](https://www.libretro.com) community for the shader pack — **thank you**. This feature would not exist without your work.

## What you get

- Play games you actually own on Steam, Epic, GOG and Amazon
- Cloud saves that carry over between your PC and your phone
- Automatically applied known configs, so many games just work out of the box with no tweaking required
- Controller and touch support, with a custom control editor and on-screen HUD
- Steam DLC, workshop and branch support
- Active support over Discord if you need help getting a game running

## How to use

1. Download the latest release [here](https://downloads.gamenative.app/releases//gamenative-v.apk)
2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Log in to your Steam account
4. Install your game
5. Hit play and enjoy

## Support

The fastest way to get help is the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2hKv4VfZfE) — we're 35k+ strong and someone's usually around.

Please **don't** open issues on GitHub; they're closed automatically. Bring it to Discord instead.

If you'd like to chip in, you can support the project on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gamenative).

## Contributing

Want to help out? Message us to get into the **#development** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2hKv4VfZfE), or open a thread there. Things we're currently looking for help with live on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vGRkFoAM/open-source-board).

### Building

Most of the time you don't need this — if you just want to play, grab the release above. This is for contributors.

1. Build it like any normal Android Studio project. Ask on Discord if you get stuck.
2. **SteamGridDB API key (optional):** to pull game artwork for custom games, add your key to `local.properties`:
   ```properties
   STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   You can get one from your [SteamGridDB preferences](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences). Without it everything still works — it just won't fetch images.

## Analytics & privacy

GameNative uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com) for anonymous analytics. No personal information is ever collected — no names, emails, IPs or device identifiers.

**Always collected**, to improve game compatibility:
- Game launch, close and exit events (game name, store, session length, average FPS, container config)
- Game install, cancel and uninstall events

This is how we figure out which games work, how well they run, and which configs to apply automatically for the next person. It can't identify you.

**Optional**, and switchable under *Settings → Info → Usage Analytics*:
- Feature usage (on-screen keyboard, controller, HUD, control editor)
- Login success/failure events
- Recommendation interactions
- App lifecycle events (foreground/background)
- Cloud sync events

The full [Privacy Policy](PrivacyPolicy/README.md) has the details.
